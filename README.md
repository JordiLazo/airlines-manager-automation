# ✈️ Airlines Manager Route Pricing Automation

This Python script automates the task of updating route prices and retrieving simulation results from the [Airlines Manager](https://www.airlines-manager.com/) web interface using Selenium.

It reads routes and their respective pricing from a CSV file, logs into your Airlines Manager account, navigates through the UI, updates each route's prices, runs a simulation, and exports the results to a new CSV file.
